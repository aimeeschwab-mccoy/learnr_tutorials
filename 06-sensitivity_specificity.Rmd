## Introduction

The Omicron variant of COVID-19 was first detected in specimens in Botswana on November 11, 2021. Since then, the variant has spread widely to become the dominant global strain.

As the Omicron variant spread, cases increased globally at an exponential pace. According to the World Health Organization, as of January 13, 2022, Ireland had recorded over one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 -- many of which were diagnosed in the weeks prior.

The rapid influx of new cases overwhelmed the public testing capacity, leading many to rely on home antigen tests to self-diagnose. The general availability and affordability of home antigen tests makes them an attractive option for testing before social events or confirming a suspected diagnosis, but are they really as accurate as PCR tests?

An observational study was conducted at two universities in Wisconsin to evaluate the performance of antigen tests compared to PCR tests. From September 28 through October 9, 2021, a total of 1,098 nasal swabs from students and faculty were tested using the Sofia SARS Antigen FIA and real time RT-PCR.

The researchers split the data into two groups: participants without COVID-19 symptoms (asymptomatic) and those with symptoms (symptomatic).

For the 871 asymptomatic participants,

|             | PCR (+) | PCR (-) | Total |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Antigen (+) | 7       | 14      | 21    |
| Antigen (-) | 10      | 840     | 850   |
| Total       | 17      | 854     | 871   |


For the 227 symptomatic participants,

|             | PCR (+) | PCR (-) | Total |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Antigen (+) | 32      | 2       | 34    |
| Antigen (-) | 8       | 185     | 193   |
| Total       | 40      | 187     | 227   |

### Check your understanding

```{r quiz1}
question("Is this an example of an experimental study or an observational study? Explain your reasoning.",
  answer("Experimental because the specimens were tested in a laboratory."),
  answer("Experimental because the participants were tested using two different methods."),
  answer("Observational because the participants volunteered to participate."),
  answer("Observational because the participants were not assigned to a particular test or intervention.", correct=TRUE)
)
```

Calculate the proportion of asymptomatic participants with a positive antigen test.

```{r exercise1, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, exercise1-solution}
21/871
```


Calculate the proportion of symptomatic participants with a positive antigen test.

```{r exercise2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, exercise2-solution}
34/227
```



## Sensitivity and specificity

Unsurprisingly, the rapid antigen test was more likely to report a positive result when the participant was symptomatic.

But, how well are antigen tests able to detect a true positive result?

In other words, __assuming an antigen test is positive, how likely is it that the participant truly has COVID-19__?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

data <- tribble(
  ~Group, ~Antigen, ~PCR, ~n,
  'Asymptomatic', 'Positive', 'Positive', 7,
  'Asymptomatic', 'Positive', 'Negative', 14,
  'Asymptomatic', 'Negative', 'Positive', 10,
  'Asymptomatic', 'Negative', 'Negative', 840,
  'Symptomatic', 'Positive', 'Positive', 32,
  'Symptomatic', 'Positive', 'Negative', 2,
  'Symptomatic', 'Negative', 'Positive', 8,
  'Symptomatic', 'Negative', 'Negative', 185
)

data <- uncount(data, weights=n)

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Antigen)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=PCR), position='dodge') + 
  facet_wrap(~Group, scales='free') + 
  labs(x='Antigen Result', y='Frequency', fill='PCR Result')
```

### Sensitivity and specificity

Two phrases used in clinical testing to describe the accuracy of a test are __sensitivity__ and __specificity__.

> __Sensitivity__: The probability of detecting a negative result, given that a subject does not have the target disease or condition

> __Specificity__: The probability of detecting a positive result, given that a subject does have the target disease or condition

A test that performs well will have relatively high sensitivity _and_ high specificity.

### Calculating sensitivity and specificity

![](https://online.stat.psu.edu/onlinecourses/sites/stat507/files/lesson06/table_01.png)

A test that performs well will have relatively high sensitivity _and_ high specificity. That is, we'd like to see relatively high values in cells $A$ and $D$, and relatively low ones in cells $B$ and $C$.

To calculate __sensitivity__,

$$Sensitivity = \frac{A}{A+C} = \frac{Number \ of \ true \ positives}{Number \ of \ test \ positives}$$

To calculate __specificity__,

$$Specificity = \frac{D}{B+D} = \frac{Number \ of \ test \ negatives}{Number \ of \ true \ negatives}$$


## Application

Let's apply these definitions to the symptomatic patients. For this group,

|             | PCR (+) | PCR (-) | Total |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Antigen (+) | 32      | 2       | 34    |
| Antigen (-) | 8       | 185     | 193   |
| Total       | 40      | 187     | 227   |

Assume that the PCR result represents the "truth" - a patient who tests positive via PCR is assumed to definitely have COVID-19. Similarly, a patient who tests negative via PCR is assumed to definitely _not_ have COVID-19.

### Calculate sensitivity

$$Sensitivity = \frac{A}{A+C} = \frac{Number \ of \ test \ positives}{Number \ of \ true \ positives}$$

|             | PCR (+) | PCR (-) | Total |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Antigen (+) | <span style="color: blue;">32</span>      | 2       | 34    |
| Antigen (-) | 8       | 185     | 193   |
| Total       | <span style="color: orange;">40</span>      | 187     | 227   |

In this example, there were <span style="color: blue;">$A=32$ test positives</span> and <span style="color: orange;">$A+C=40$ true positives</span>.

$$Sensitivity = \frac{A}{A+C} = \frac{32}{40}=0.80 = 80\%$$

### Interpretation

In other words, __based on this data we expect the rapid antigen test to detect about 80% of true positives in symptomatic patients__.

### Calculate specificity

$$Specificity = \frac{D}{B+D} = \frac{Number \ of \ test \ negatives}{Number \ of \ true \ negatives}$$

Use the calculation box below to calculate the specificity of this test for symptomatic patients.

```{r exercise3, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, exercise3-solution}
185/187
```

### Interpretation

```{r quiz2}
question("Choose the best interpretation.",
  answer("The rapid antigen test will detect about 98.9% of true negatives in symptomatic patients."),
  answer("Based on this data, we expect the rapid antigen test to detect about 98.9% of true negatives in symptomatic patients.", correct=TRUE),
  answer("About 98.9% of symptomatic participants will test negative on both the rapid antigen test and PCR test.")
)
```

## Practice

Consider the asymptomatic patients.

For the 871 asymptomatic participants,

|             | PCR (+) | PCR (-) | Total |
|-------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Antigen (+) | 7       | 14      | 21    |
| Antigen (-) | 10      | 840     | 850   |
| Total       | 17      | 854     | 871   |

Use the calculation box below to calculate the specificity of this test for asymptomatic patients.

```{r exercise4, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, exercise4-solution}
840/854
```

Use the calculation box below to calculate the specificity of this test for asymptomatic patients.

```{r exercise5, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r, exercise5-solution}
7/17
